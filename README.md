# Optimal-Experimental-Design
Title: Optimal Sensor Placement for Atmospheric Inverse Modeling Using Bilevel Optimization

Write-up is available on Overleaf.

"Opti..._SAA" and "Opti..._SGD" files are implementations of the Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 for the example we used for IEEE BigData paper.
"Opti..._SGD_ElasticNet" is the variant of "Opti..._SGD" by considering the ElasticNet regularization in inverse modeling.

More codes are coming soon.
